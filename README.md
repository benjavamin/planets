The aim of this project was to showcase the proper use of core web concepts using HTML, CSS and JS. Despite facing significant time constraints due to external factors, my aim was to incorporate as many core aspects as possible. To minimize the risk of producing duplicated and redundant code, I decided to take a JS-heavy approach. In doing so, I was careful to avoid using any features that might not be supported in certain browser versions, such as computed styles, variables etc.

To ensure consistency, I included a few files that serve a purely semantic purpose. These files contain a summary of the fonts, colors and styles used throughout the project. In a real-world setting, these files would include all of the theme variables used in the project, making it much easier to maintain and update values in the future.

While the project achieved its goals, there is always room for improvement. One area where we could further reduce repeated and duplicated code is by adopting SASS (SCSS). By doing so, we could streamline our codebase and make it even more efficient.

I also took steps to enhance accessibility, including the use of aria-label tags and tabIndex attributes.
